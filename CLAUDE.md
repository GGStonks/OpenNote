# OpenNote — notes for Claude

## The ink engine is frozen

`src/ink/engine/` (Nib v1: `nib.ts`, `liveStroke.ts`, `geometry.ts`, `index.ts`) is final. The owner
has said it must never be changed again. Tag: `nib-engine-v1`.

- Do not edit anything in `src/ink/engine/`, not its `NIB` parameters, not "small" tweaks, not
  refactors. If a task seems to need an engine change, say so and ask; do not do it.
- New features that need ink (shape tools, retracing, Android, …) use the engine through
  `src/ink/engine/index.ts` (`NibModeler`, `nibStroke`, `LiveStroke`, geometry helpers), outside the folder.
- `npm run test:engine` compares the engine's output (live, finished, nibStroke) on fixed strokes with
  `bench/engine-golden.json` to 1e-4 px. `npm run build` runs it first, so a changed engine cannot be
  built or released. Never regenerate the reference (`--update`) to make a change pass.
- The engine must behave the same on iPad (iOS shell 240 Hz samples, `src/ink/nativePencil.ts`) and
  Android (Chromium coalesced pointer events): platform differences are handled in the input layer
  (`src/components/CanvasPage.tsx`), never inside the engine.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` — engine test, type-check, production build
- `npm run bench:pen` — synthetic pen benchmark; `npm run bench:replay -- bench/recordings/<file>.json` — real recordings (Settings → Diagnostics → Record pen strokes → Send to PC)
- `/home/ds/AI/OpenNote_release.sh` — builds APK + IPA, tags and publishes the GitHub release
